# Data visualisation examination project

## Initial data exploration
The following plots is use as a initial analysis of the dataset.
- [Heatmap](http://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/KCLT_heatmap.html)
- [SPLOM](http://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/SPLOM.html)
- [Scattermatrix of precipitation over all temperature attributes](http://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/Scatter_matrix_of_precipitation_over_temp.html)
- [Scatter plot of corerlation between min and max temperature records](http://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/Corr_min_max.htmll)

## Data analysis
- [Scatter and box plot of measured temperature](http://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/temp_min_max_avg_scatter.html)
- [Scatter plot and histogram of temperature records](https://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/temp_min_max_record_scatter.html)
- [Bar plot of temperature records and year of event](https://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/Bar_plot_min_max_records.html)
- [Scatter plot of precipitation](https://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/record_average_precipitation_scatter.html)

## Interaction design test

### On which date was the highest temperature measured? 
### What are the median of the mean?
Find the answer in the link below
- [Scatter and box plot of measured temperature](http://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/temp_min_max_avg_scatter.html)

### What is the range/interval for min and max temperature records?
Find the answer in the link below:
- [Scatter plot and histogram of temperature records](https://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/temp_min_max_record_scatter.html)

### Is it possible to tell wether there is more max records than min, or vice versa?
### How many and what kind of records was recorded between 1993-1996?
Find the answer in the link below
- [Bar plot of temperature records and year of event](https://RonniCarlsen.github.io/Plots/Bar_plot_min_max_records.html)


### By looking at the plot, is it then possible to tell how many precipitation records were made in the periode from July 2014 to July 2015?
